# voiceterminal
control computers.. with your voice - powered by AI

## 🚀 Current Features

- Voice and text input modes
- Dynamic command generation using GPT-4 (can switch out AI models easily, in the future will be controlled with local AI)
- Execution of system commands (very dangerous! dont mention "soda" around)
- Text-to-speech feedback 
- Safety checks for potentially dangerous commands

## 🔮 Future Vision

we aim to revolutionize computer interaction, enabling users to fully control their PCs using voice commands alone. Our roadmap includes:

- Providing file system context (e.g., `tree` command integration, recursive cat of important files and codebase context)
- Maintaining conversation history for more context-aware interactions
- Expanding command capabilities to include coding tasks
- Implementing application launching and control
- Enhancing accessibility features for users with limited mobility

## 🎯 Goal

Our ultimate goal is to create a hands-free computing experience, making technology more accessible to everyone, regardless of physical limitations.

## ⚠️ Alpha Status

Please note that this is currently in alpha. It may contain bugs and its features are subject to change. Use with caution, especially when executing system commands.
